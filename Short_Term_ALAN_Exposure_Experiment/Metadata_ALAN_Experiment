Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) Bradley's Head Reserve Light Experiment Metadata

Date: 21 - 24 July 2020  

Location: Bradley's Head Reserve, Sydney Harbour, Australia

Description: This project was conducted for Megan Trethewy's Master of Research at Macquarie University, Sydney Australia. 
Three light treatments, White LED, Yellow LED and Red LED, as well as a control (no lights), were installed randomly along the intertidal zone. There were two repliates for each of the light treatments. Each of the lights were set to 25 lx, using a handheld light metre. The lights were left on for three hours during the overnight low tide, for three nights in a row.  
Ecological surveys were conducted within 2m around the base of the light structure before and after the lights were turned on at night, as well as during the day. Ten photographs were taken for each replicate, four at the base of the light, 3 at 1m away from the light, and another 3 two metres away. 
Each of the pictures is listed in the raw data "Bradleys_Head_July_Data.xlsx", and indicates the overall species richness, percent coverage of sessile algal species as well as the abundance and diversity of mobile species. 
Wax discs were also used to assess the activity and intensity of grazing species under each of light treatments and the control. The results are listed in the raw data "Light_Exp_WD_Data.xlsx". 
These were made from dental wax and crown seal bottle caps, were installed on the substrate using epoxy putty and left for the duration of the experiment (3 nights). Once the period of time had passed, the percent of the disc that had been grazed as well as the number and diversity of markings left by the radular of grazing species was assessed using a dissecting microscope.
